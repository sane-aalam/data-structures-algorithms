// Real-Life Example:
// Looking up a word in a dictionary
// Let’s say you want to find the word “Binary” in an English dictionary:
// You don’t start from page 1, right?
// You open somewhere in the middle → let’s say the page starts with “Mathematics.”
// “Binary” comes before “Mathematics,” so you go left (earlier pages).
// Keep repeating this until you find the exact page.
// That’s binary search in action: cut the search space in half every time

// How to identify the pattern of Binary Search
// You have to think
// 1. Sorted array
// 2. Sorted in Rotated Sorted Array
// 3. Search Space (Allocation)
// 5. Sorted and Rotated Order
